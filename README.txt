This is a fork of the Adafruit_ILI9341 library for Arduino and combatible boards. The purpose of the fork is to:
 1. Use of the ConnD_GFX library for TFT display 

The library works with TFT displays that are equipped with ILI9341 chip. 

This library will be used for the ConnDuino board projects. For more info about the board visit:  www.connduino.com

              DEPENDENCIES
=========================================================================
Requires the ConnD_GFX library.

              INSTALLATION 
=========================================================================
To download, click the DOWNLOAD ZIP button, uncompress and rename the uncompressed folder to "ConnD_ILI9341". Place the "ConnD_ILI9341" library folder to your arduino environment "<sketch folder>/libraries" subfolder. You can see, and even change, your <sketch folder> in the IDE under the menu File>Preferences. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if this is your first library. Restart the IDE.


              ADAFRUIT_ILI9341 master, README 
=========================================================================
This is a library for the Adafruit ILI9341 display products

This library works with the Adafruit 2.8" Touch Shield V2 (SPI)
